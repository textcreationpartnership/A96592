            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>OUt of <hi>all</hi> this that hath been ſpoken, it is <hi>more</hi> then mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that the King ought to have the <hi>ſupreme</hi> power over Gods Church, and the government thereof, and the <hi>greateſt</hi> care to preſerve true religion throughout all his Dominions: this is his <hi>duty,</hi> and this is his <hi>honour,</hi> that God hath committed not a people, but <hi>his people,</hi> and the members of his Son under his charge. For the <hi>performance</hi> of which charge, it is requiſite for us to know, that God hath granted unto him, among other rights,<note place="margin">Two ſpeciall rights and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of the King, for the government of the Church.</note> theſe two ſpeciall prerogatives.</p>

                  <hi>on every ſide round about him,</hi> to reſtore his Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy to their <hi>priſtine</hi> ſtation, that when theſe <hi>bramble</hi> rods are burnt, and theſe <hi>rebels</hi> fallen, the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> may ſtill ſtand like <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to guide and governe Gods people committed to their charge.</p>
               <p>And <hi>thus</hi> I have <hi>ſhewed</hi> thee, ô man, ſome of the <hi>ſacred</hi> rights of <hi>royall</hi> Majeſty, <hi>granted</hi> by God in his holy Scriptures, <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed</hi> by Kings from the beginning of the world, <hi>yielded</hi> by all nations, that had none other guide, but the <hi>light</hi> of nature to direct them; I have <hi>alſo</hi> ſhewed thee how the <hi>people,</hi> greedy of liberty and licenciouſneſſe, have like the true children of old <hi>Adam,</hi> that could not long endure the <hi>ſweet</hi> yoke of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>ſtrived</hi> and ſtrugled to withdraw their necks from that ſubjection (which their <hi>condition</hi> required, and their <hi>froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> neceſſitated to be impoſed upon them) and thereby have either <hi>graciouſly</hi> gained ſuch love and favour from many <hi>pious</hi> and moſt clement Princes, as for the <hi>ſweetning</hi> of their well <hi>merited</hi> ſubjection, to grant them many <hi>immunities</hi> and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, or have moſt <hi>rebelliouſly</hi> incroached upon theſe rights of Kings, wreſting many <hi>liberties</hi> out of the hands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>forcibly</hi> retaining them to their owne advantage, ſometimes to the <hi>overthrow</hi> of the royall Government (as <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus</hi> and his aſſociates did the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the <hi>diminution</hi> of the <hi>dimidium</hi> if not more then <hi>halfe</hi> his right, (as the <hi>Ephori</hi> did to the Kings of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi>) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to the great <hi>prejudice</hi> of the King, and the greater <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe</hi> to the Common-wealth; becauſe both <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience</hi> hath found it alwayes true, that the <hi>regall</hi> government, or Monarchicall State, though it might <hi>ſometimes</hi> happen to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:155310:127"/> prove tyrannicall, is farre more <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God, as being his owne <hi>prime</hi> and proper ordinance, moſt <hi>agreeable</hi> unto nature, and more <hi>profitable</hi> unto all men, then either the <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall</hi> or <hi>Popular</hi> government, either <hi>hath,</hi> or poſſibly <hi>can</hi> be; for, as it is moſt true, that <hi>praſtat ſub malo principe eſſe, quàm ſub nullo,</hi> it is better to live under an <hi>ill</hi> governour, then where there is <hi>no</hi> government; ſo <hi>praeſtat ſub uno tyranno vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, quàm ſub mille,</hi> it is better to be under the command of <hi>one</hi> tyrant then of a <hi>thouſand,</hi> as we are now under theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells: who being not <hi>faex Romuli,</hi> the worſt of the <hi>Nobility,</hi> but <hi>faex populi,</hi> the dreggs of the <hi>people,</hi> indigent Mechanicks, and their Wives captivated <hi>Citizens,</hi> together with the rabble of ſeduced <hi>Sectaries,</hi> have ſo <hi>diſloyally</hi> incroached upon the rights of our King, and ſo <hi>rebelliouſly</hi> uſurped the ſame, to the utter <hi>ſubverſion</hi> both of Church and Kingdome, if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who <hi>hath the hearts of all Kings in his hand,</hi> and turneth the ſame, <hi>whereſoever he pleaſeth,</hi> had not moſt graciouſly <hi>ſtrengthned</hi> his Majeſty with a moſt <hi>ſingular</hi> and heroick reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, aſſiſted with <hi>perfect</hi> health from the beginning of their <hi>inſurrection</hi> to this very day, to the <hi>admiration</hi> of his enemies, and the exceeding <hi>joy</hi> and comfort of his faithfull Subjects, and with the beſt <hi>ayde</hi> and furtherance of his chiefeſt <hi>Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> of all his learned and religious <hi>Clergy,</hi> his grave and honeſt <hi>Lawyers,</hi> and the truly worthy <hi>Gentry</hi> of his whole Kingdome, to withſtand their moſt <hi>treacherous,</hi> impious, barbarous, and I know not how to expreſſe the <hi>wickedneſſe</hi> of their moſt hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid attempts: ſo thou haſt before thee <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> fire and water, good and evill.</p>
               <p>And therefore, I hope that this will <hi>move</hi> us (which have our eyes open, to behold the <hi>great</hi> bleſſings, and the <hi>many</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt miraculous deliverances and favours of God unto his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and to conſider the moſt <hi>horrible</hi> deſtruction that this warre hath brought upon us) to <hi>feare</hi> God and to <hi>honour</hi> our King, to <hi>hate</hi> the Rebells and to <hi>love</hi> all loyall Subjects; to doe our uttermoſt endeavour to <hi>quench</hi> this devouring flame, and to that end, with <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> and with our <hi>fortunes</hi> and with the hazard of our <hi>lives</hi> (which, as our Saviour ſaith,
